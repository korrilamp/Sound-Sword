# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 11/7 â€“ 11/13
This week our goals involved solidifying decisions for the base audio and visual effects are program will offer.

### Weekly Activities and Progress
We met with our sponsor on Tuesday, and met as a team on Friday. 
At the Tuesday meeting, we walked Prof. Intriligator through our design document; He thought it was well developed and will be a good framework for the project. At the meeting we also discussed how our program will allow users to save/store data and how the program itself will read/use data. Kevin mentioned that Prof. Remco Chang, who teaches computer visualizations, may be a helpful resource for questions around data storage with our project. Our sponsor also provided us with the contacts of 3 additional professors who are interested in the project and would be open to meeting. 

During and after that meeting, we selected the audio and visual effects to prioritize as a team. Two of the major features are: The ability for the user to select different tracks (sound files) to make them do different things moving around in the virtual environment, and the ability to place a visual element at a particular spatial location. We realize that users should have multiple options for these visual elements (including things like spheres, paths, particle storms, etc).

When we met as a team on Friday, we compiled a list of the audio and visual parameters:

AUDIO

- Amplitude
- Average Frequency
- Info extracted via Fourier Transforms
- Layering Mixer Features to Track 

-- Reverb
-- Pitchbend
-- Gain
-- Chorus
-- Flanger
-- Delay
-- Phaser
-- Compression

VISUAL

- Type
-- Particle cloud (If cloud, what do we want users to be able to control about it? (speed of particles, amount of particles, density, size, etc.)
--Solid Shape? (select from set of shapes - sphere, cube, prism, cone, cylinder, torus)
-- Path (Width of path)

-Permanant vs. Fading
-- Time of fade

-Color
--Changing over time(?)

- Position (Map from xyz, or other(?))
- Opacity
- Reflective
