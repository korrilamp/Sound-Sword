# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 11/16 â€“ 11/20

### Weekly Activities and Progress
This week, we worked to further specify the audio parameters we want to work with.
We had a great meeting with our sponsor, Prof. Intriligator, about what an appropriate demo would look like.
We decided that implementing another audio parameter besides 3D position would be enough to showcase that we can
handle varying audio parameters. We also discussed some steps to take in order to solidify what functions we will need.
Our plan is to create a task analysis on Monday in order to create a flow for how this product will be used, and
what the application needs to do at each step. We are hoping that this will give us a clearer idea of what functions we
need.

### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the area, we have determined that it is unlikely
that we will be able to get access to the lab in order to work with the headsets that the HFE department owns.
Because of this lack of access, Prof. Intriligator has generously offered to lend us one of his headset which
will be able to use for prototyping. While this is not as ideal as the whole team being able to work together in the
lab, given the circumstances this seems like a great solution. Cameron and Kevin will trade the headset back and forth over
the course of the rest of the project.

### Notes on Successes
We were able to specify our requirments further and have an action plan next week in order to be able to
figure out more of the details of what we need to implemenmt. Professor Intriligator also was kind enough to offer
us one of his headsets, solving our issue with access to the lab.

### Failures
We still have yet to make concrete progress on the Unity project and have spent the bulk of our time
specifying our requirments. We intend to make progress on this in the next week.
