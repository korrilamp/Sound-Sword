### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
We are still awaiting information from our sponsor about either getting access to the Occulus Headsets for

We still need to narrow down the parameters for the visual and audio components of the project.

### Notes on Successes
Our team was able to get a better understanding of the prototype code, thanks to the discussion with
Professor Intrilligator's son.

### Failures
We were not able to think of the parameters needed for audio and visual components this week.
