# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 10/26 â€“ 10/30

### Weekly Activities and Progress
This week we were able to meet with professor Intrilligator's son, Eli, and Eli's girlfriend, Fiona, who had started on this project over the
summer to get a better understanding of the prototype code. Eli and Fiona walked us though the different scripts in the code and explained 
their functionality and relevance to the final product. They also explained to us where they had difficulties which we may want to tackle,
such as simultaneously playing back multiple positional files.
We decided to develop story boards for our project in order to identify which features are the most crucial to develop first.

### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
We are still awaiting information from our sponsor about either getting access to the Occulus Headsets for
development. Without access to the Headsets, it will be difficult to test the current prototype and any
progress we may make in future weeks. We will also need to select few features from the many ideas offered
by our sponsor.

We still need to narrow down the parameters for the visual and audio components of the project.

### Notes on Successes
Our team was able to get a better understanding of the prototype code, thanks to the discussion with
Professor Intrilligator's son.

### Failures
We were not able to think of the parameters needed for audio and visual components this week.
