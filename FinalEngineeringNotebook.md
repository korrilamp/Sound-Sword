The Joel Test

1. Do you use source control?
- No, the version of Unity weâ€™re using does not have built-in source control
2. Can you make a build in one step?
- No, but during testing Unity can demo changes in one step
3. Do you make daily builds?
- No, our team consists of students who do not have time to make daily builds.
4. Do you have a bug database?
- Not yet. This will be something we will tackle next semester
5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
- We will fix bugs before writing new code going forward.
6. Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
- Yes, our schedule reflects our plans through winter break
7. Do you have a spec?
- Yes, our design document lays out our current specifications and what we want to accomplish as we continue to work on the project
8. Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
- Yes, due to covid restrictions. Every team member is working from home and we each have a private room to work.
9. Do you use the best tools money can buy?
- No, there are constraints that impact our ability to each have an Oculus headset and PC with the minimum specs to run VR. In the future, we hope to have access to the human factors research lab. 
10. Do you have testers? 
- Yes, we will test the effectiveness of our application with our current housemates. 
11. Do new candidates write code during their interview?
- Yes, we all have to code and we are new candidates I suppose
12. Do you do hallway usability testing?
- Yes, the testing we do will be very quick and iterative with whoever is around and able.


Here is the miro link that we have been working on over the past couple of weeks

Last accomplishments:
- We were able to create a task analysis of Painting/Drawing.
- Then, We tied the task analysis to a parallel description of painting visual or audio elements in a vr application.
- Finally, we were able to tie these descriptions into general functions to be used in the application
- We also were able to create three separate modules to describe the application: Load/Save module, Draw/Paint module for visuals or audio, and Playback module

We also met with Professor Intriligator's son to get a better understanding of the source code he implemented with his team.

- Finally we were able to map the controller/user-controlled parameter to an audio parameter (volume). This was the basis of our Proof of Concept.

Plans going forward (i.e. over the break)
- Weekly meetings starting January
- Continue to code and work on implementing the integration of our big picture modules (Save/Load module, Playback Module, and Draw Module)
