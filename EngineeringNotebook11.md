# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 3/1 â€“ 3/5

### Weekly Activities and Progress
* We met as a group in the EPDC in the SEC with the VR equipment and worked together for the first time so we were able to make a nice amount of progress
with developing the core audio mixer and scripts of our program. 
* We are going with an approach to the audio effects where they are applied to sound sources
through sends and receives of exposed parameters in the mixer. 
* Tim achieved a mockup of the functionality we hoped for that worked with mouse input, so we 
used our time together to make the method work in the program with VR controller position input. 
* We had to generate some transition functions to bring the position values into the right range for our effects. 
* * Testing the program with modified echo levels, reverb levels, and pitchshifting worked well and we are hopeful about this method for 
the rest  of the audio effects.
 

### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
The big parts remaining to develop for our program are:
* Applying effects to more than one layer of audio
* Visual effects
* User Interface and Menus
* Program launching/sound file storage 

Within the team we are dividing to lead efforts on the development of these components but wee are hoping to continue meeting 2-3 
times each week throughout the semester so that as many features as possible can make it into the program.
