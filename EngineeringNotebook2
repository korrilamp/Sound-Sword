# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 10/12 â€“ 10/16

### Weekly Activities and Progress
We recieved the code for the prototype of the project from Eli this week
and began to discuss what steps we should take to take in order to further our 
understanding of our needs. The prototype of the project includes movements of the
"sound sword" and the associated movement of a sound source. The current project
also includes some visuals that react to users movement, namely a stream of particles
that follow the path of the "sound sword". We hope to build off of this and create a more
user controlled enviroment in which users can select what kind of visuals and audio they
experience. The current interface also does not include any manner of selection of audio
files, which is something we are looking to include in future iterations.


We met as a team on Tuesday 10/13/2020.
*We shared the code for the prototype with one another and determined the proper 
Unity version needed to work with the project.
*We discussed the need to analyze the prototpye code in order to understand 
how we might best build off of previous progress
*We began to discuss some of the risk factors involved in this product (motion sickness, seizsures)
and our need to conduct further research on the risks associated with VR in general.


### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
We are still awaiting information from our sponsor about either getting access to the Occulus Headsets for
development. Without access to the Headsets, it will be difficult to test the current prototype and any
progress we may make in future weeks. 

### Notes on Successes
Our team established needs in order to sucessfully complete our upcoming deliverables. 

### Failures
We miscummicated about a potential meeting with our sponsor this week, resulting in us meeting
less than we hoped to. We also failed to complete the research on sound libraries we had
hoped to do this week. We will look to complete this research next week.
