# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 4/12-4/16

### Weekly Activities and Progress
Early this week we had to meet to recover from an error in the code that arose last week after copy/pasting code sent through Slack between team members into our Unity file. 
We met in the middle of the week to finalize our poster for the virtual showcase.
We met once more on Thursday and had to debug scripts that send the value the user chooses in the front end to the DrawController script that instantiates and mutes the effect levels

### Next Steps

In the upcoming 2 weeks left until our demo, the group intends on continuing to meet in person 2-3x each week with additional communication on zoom and slack to accomplish the following goals:
* Finish fully debugging the core audio effects
* Elevate the visual design of the user interface 
* Finish implementation of replyManager script that handles playback
