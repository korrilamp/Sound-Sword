# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 10/31 â€“ 11/6

### Weekly Activities and Progress
This week we met and finalized our Design Document for SoundSword. This included narrowing down 
the parameters we plan on using, finalizing our control layout, and finalizing our data storage
types. 

### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
We need to begin testing our current code base, which requires us to have VR Headset Lab access.
Korri has kindly applied for all of us, so we should find out soon what our accesss schedule is 
like. This will also allow us to start developing our prototype. 

### Notes on Successes
The Design Document was one of our required deliverables for the class. 

### Failures
We planned to meet with Professor Intrilligator this week, but had too many conflicts in our 
schedule. We are setting a plan to meet sometime next week, to make up for it.
