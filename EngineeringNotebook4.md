# Engineering Notebook 
## Week 10/19 â€“ 10/23

### Weekly Activities and Progress
This week looked into the code for the prototype of the project. We also met with professor Intriligator
this week and shared our progress with him as well as our plan for moving forwards. We were given
an alternative idea to the VR audio visualization; instead we would only develop playback of the
audio visualization experience and this time it would be on VR google cardboard. Although this would
narrow down our ideas and would be easier for our team to implement and complete given the duration of
our Senior Capstone course, we ultimately decided on sticking with the original VR headset audio
visualization idea. The main reason for the decision was "we wanted something cooler and more like a
capstone project."
Additionally, we were able to complete our Risk Assessments and send out a survey to fetch data
from a wide variety of consumers/users.

We met as a team on Tuesday 10/20/2020.

We looked into the code for the prototype but was unable to run the code without a VR headset
We created a Risk Assessment survey to attain data for the project: https://forms.gle/ag1gWkBuniSSi7T48
We began to discuss some of the risk factors involved in this product (motion sickness, seizsures)
and our need to conduct further research on the risks associated with VR in general.

We had a 1:1 meeting with Ming on Tuesday 10/20/2020.

We talked about the progress we have made thus far.
Ming gave us some tips when working with many ideas: Narrow it down to what we want.
We are right on track (if not ahead)

### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
We are still awaiting information from our sponsor about either getting access to the Occulus Headsets for
development. Without access to the Headsets, it will be difficult to test the current prototype and any
progress we may make in future weeks. We will also need to select few features from the many ideas offered
by our sponsor.

### Notes on Successes
Our team was able to narrow down on the scope of the project. We decided to stick with the original VR
experience idea with select features to implement.

### Failures
Not all members were able to open the prototype unity project.
We still haven't totally narrowed down our project idea.
