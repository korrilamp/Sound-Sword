## Week 4/17-4/21

### Weekly Activities and Progress

### Weekly Activities and Progress
This week, we finished the interface for the UI and completed some interactivity between the UI and the audio mixer. This allows users to change which audio parameters connect to
positional data. We are currently resolving a bug that arose during this process; audio parameters in the mixer are changing correctly, however, the track is not changing when 
output through the headphones. 

### Next Steps

In the upcoming week left until our demo, the group intends on continuing to meet in person 2-3x each week with additional communication on zoom and slack to accomplish the following goals:
* Finish fully debugging the core audio effects
* Finish implementation of replyManager script that handles playback
* Finish documentation for the project for future use
