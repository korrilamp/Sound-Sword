# Engineering Notebook Entry #1
## Week 10/4 – 10/9

### Weekly Activities and Progress
We met with our sponsor, Prof. James Intriligator on Thursday 10/1/2020.
* James gave us more information about his vision for this project and motivation
* He has synesthesia: a condition where when you listen to music you see patterns
* Having Synesthesia has led him to want to share the visions he sees with others – his
motivation behind this project can be summarized in the quote: “How do you capture
something so temporally dependent and share it?”
*He sees this program as eventually being “a paintbrush for this new art form”, where
the new art form is the intersection of audio and visuals. 

Our sponsor commissioned his son (Eli Intriligator) + his son’s partner to work on a prototype for
this concept over the past summer.
* They so far have made a mockup in Unity that allows the user to sort of “paint” complex
visuals and patterns (based on an audio track) from a saber that he calls the “sound
sword”
* Since they have made the recorder/painter/visualizer, the main direction James hopes
for us to develop is the playback aspect so people can share these experiences with
others and show them what they created. 

We met as a team on Thursday 10/8/2020
* We discussed the direction we are most excited about moving in as a team – that is,
working together to develop one of the couple of aspects James would like to see
realized for this project.
▪ Shaders
▪ Sound
▪ +Intersection
* Rather than working as individuals or duos to accomplish individual aspects, we
determined we will try to work as a group to iteratively develop one major feature set at
a time (i.e. sound, then, if we get a good prototype of sound, move onto shaders, etc.)
* We are going to work with monthly individual contribution goals in mind instead of
specific weekly goals, given the very open-ended nature of our project and broad range
of features/outcomes our sponsor sees as exciting potential adds.

Next, we are going to be doing a deep dive into the existing Unity work that James’ son Eli has
already programmed this Summer to understand what we are working with in terms of the
painter/sound sword itself

After, we are going to spend the latter half of next week investigating sound libraries, Unity
store assets, and other existing work that could be helpful supplements to the work we
create/code. 

### Upcoming Challenges (potential blockers)
We are awaiting information from our sponsor about either getting access to the HFE lab in 574 Boston
to use the VR and PC equipment for development OR individually getting Oculus headsets to work with
at home for the duration of our project. Once we know specific information about how we can access
Oculus headset(s) to develop on, it will help us be able to plan out how we will tackle actual
development/iteration on Eli’s existent prototype. 

### Notes on Successes
Our team has established good a communication channel among us, and between us and our sponsor
on a slack workspace we created for the project.
We also have set up biweekly meetings with our sponsor to check in periodically and stay on track –
which we realize will be especially helpful in our very freeform project.
