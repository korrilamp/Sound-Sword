Engineering Notebook Entry #1
Week 10/4 – 10/9

Weekly Activities and Progress
We met with our sponsor, Prof. James Intriligator on Thursday 10/1/2020.
o James gave us more information about his vision for this project and motivation
o He has synesthesia: a condition where when you listen to music you see patterns
o Having Synesthesia has led him to want to share the visions he sees with others – his
motivation behind this project can be summarized in the quote: “How do you capture
something so temporally dependent and share it?”
o He sees this program as eventually being “a paintbrush for this new art form”, where
the new art form is the intersection of audio and visuals.
